# Scrub-Cup
Basically, this is for the Overwatch scrub Cup. I have all the entries in a .csv file.
This is intended to read the file, and add all the players to c++.
Each player is a player class, and there are two division classes, one for EU and one for NA.
This is setting up the tools necessary to sort into teams based on SR and role, and I plan to have it write the results to another .csv file.
If someone is good at using email with c++, we could also automate sending out an email with their team-members on it
